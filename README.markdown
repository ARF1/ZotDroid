A Zotero Client for Android devices
-----------------------------------

[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org) is a fantasic program for anyone doing any kind of research. I like to use my tablet to read PDFs and similar so I wanted an Android client. There wasn't one on the market that I liked so I wrote my own.
